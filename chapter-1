QUESTIONS CHAPTER 1 (Reliable,Scalable and Maintainable Applications ) 

What are some of the ways human errors can be reduced in software systems?
How about approaches to curb systematic errors?

SCALABILITY
If a system grows in a particular way, what are the options for coping  with the load?(LPE)
How can you add computing resources to handle the load?(LPE)

SCALABILITY - Describing Load
TO discuss growth questions, we need to SUCCINCTLY describe the current load on the system. 
Load is described with load parameters.
From the architecture of your system, what will you choose as your load parameters?
eg. of load parameters are: 
a. requests per second to a web server, 
b. the ratio or  reads to writes in a database, 
c. the number of simultaneously active users in a chat room
d. The hit rate on a cache, etc
OPINION: Knowing the load informs on what to measure, how to regulate it. Probably from the architecture.
How do you define the load parameter from the architecture?
eg Twitter's Approach
